Angular Vs React
--------------------------
Angular
Angular is a complete framework that provodes a wide range of features for building web apps (eg dependency injection, two-way binding etc).

More built-in features


React
Does not provide as many built-in features as Angular

Focuses solely on view layer of an app


When deciding which one to use,
depends on your project requirement and team preference
large, complex application which requires more built-in features -> Angular
small project, prioritize flexibility and performance -> React





What is Angular
----------------------------
- a frontend framework that makes it easy to build apps for web/mobile.
- an open source project, primarily maintained by Google
- Built entirely in TypeScript (superset of JavaScript)
- angular used ts as its primary language, we'll be writing code in ts




Features of Angular
--------------------------------
1) exceptional scaling and performance
2) cross platform - mobile, web and desktop
3) Single Page Application (SPA)
4) TS Language
5) Declarative Templates
6) Dependency Injection
7) End to end tooling




Angular Version History
-------------------------------------------
                    AngularJS (Angular 1) (in js)
                            |
                    Angular 2 (complete rewrite of angularjs) (in ts from here)
                            |
                    Angular 4 (v3 was skipped due to some internal reason on conflict bw router package and angular)
                            |
                    Angular 5
                            |
                            |
                    Angular 14 (-new version releases periodically
                                -backward compatible from v4)





Environment Setup
-----------------------------------
1) download and install nodejs
2) npm (automatically installed with node)
3) Download and install VSCode

4) in terninal, 
    npm i -g @angular/cli       //install angular cli globally
    ng new <project_name>       //create a new project my-first-app
    ng serve                    //run the app

node -v
to check node version

npm -v
to check npm version

CLI: Command Line Interface
Angular CLI provides some commands and schematics which helps us with faster code generation.
        eg.
        commands
                ng new
                ng generate module <module_name>
                ng generate component <component_name>

        schematics
                ng serve
                ng build
                ng test

In npm, -g or --global flag is used to indicate that a package should be installed globally rather than locally. That means package will be installed to a global directory and can be used by other projects on same machine.

default port of angular is 4200

url - http://localhost:4200  -> to view app in browser
