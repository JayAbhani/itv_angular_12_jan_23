Environment Setup
----------------------------

Installing Bootstrap
- there are two ways to include/install bootstrap in angular apps:
    1) CDN
    2) NPM Package

1) cdn
take cdn urls for styles and script and link them in index.html file of angular application

2) using npm
step-1 : install bootstrap package
    npm install bootstrap --save

step-2 : include css and js files in angular.json

step-3 : also make sure you have jquery(optional for bootstrap 5) and popper.js installed

step-4 : also include jquery and popper.js in angular.json

step-5 : restart your application


--save or -S flag:
    - gets included in 'dependencies' section of package.json
    - to keep track and manage these dependencies wuth future installs, upgrades and uninstalls
    - also to use them in production

--save-dev or -D flag
    - in 'devDependencies'
    - only using them in development environment




Folder Structure in Angular
-----------------------------------




Boot Process of Angular Apps
----------------------------------------
ng serve
    compiling the application
    (index.html)
    main.ts
        bootstrapModule
            AppModule
                AppComponent
                    <app-root>


whenever we do ng serve/build/test, cli compiles our ts into js code
    -> transpiling
            main.js
            styles.js
            runtime.js
            etc..





Angular Apps Architecture
----------------------------------------
angular is a modular-based architecture
src
    students                //module
        add-student         //component
        edit-student        //component
        delete-student      //component
        view-student        //component

    employees               //module
        add-employee        //component
            |






Angular Modules
----------------------------------------
all the related functionalities is grouped in a module

there are lots of built-in modules
    eg. BrowserModule
        BrowsersAnimationsModule

module is a grouping of
    components
    services
    pipes
    directives
    etc..

every angular application should have at least one module by default, angular provides us with AppModule

we can turn on or off the modules based on conditions

creating a custom module
    ng generate module students





Angular Components
-------------------------
most important and basic building block of an agular application

smallest functionality that will be implemented in your application

we can have components inside components
    -> parent-child relationship

eg
    students                //module
        add-student         //component
        edit-student        //component
        delete-student      //component
        view-student        //component
            download-pdf    //component

    authentication
        new-user
        login
        forgot-password

every components has 4 files
    1) component.html   ->  view or html or template
    2) component.css    ->  stylesheet
    3) component.ts     ->  a class file which will have logic
    4) component.spec.ts    ->  unit test script for component

component decorator inside component.ts
    selector - unique identifier for component
    templateUrl - html file
    styleUrls - css files

creating angular component
    ng g component <comp_name>
    




Templates in Angular Components
-----------------------------------------
<comp_name>.component.html

two ways of using templates in a component
    1) templateUrl
        link html file (only one)
    2) template
        pass html code using ` ` (backticks)

stylesUrl
    array
    can have multiple stylesheets
