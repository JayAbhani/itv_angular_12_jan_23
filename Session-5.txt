Data Binding
-----------------------------
- to bind data from template to component class and vice versa.

- defines how data flows

- There are two types of Data Binding:
    1. one-way data binding
        a. component to view
            i. interpolation
            ii. property binding
        b. view to component
            event binding

    2. two-way data binding
        from component to view AND
        from view to component


interpolation
-------------------------------
- to bind data from component to view
- syntax
    {{ variable_name }}



property binding
----------------------
- to bind properties of elems from component to view
- syntax
    [property] = "expression"




event binding
-------------------------
- to bind events of elems from view to comonent
- can be used for all available events
- syntax
    (event_name)="function()"




two-way data binding
--------------------------------
- data flows from view to component and vice versa
- data flow is both ways
- combination of property binding and event binding
- ngModel is a built-in directive which handles both property and event binding on same element.
- syntax
    [(ngModel)] = "data"
